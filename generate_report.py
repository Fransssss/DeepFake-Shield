        DeepFake Shield â€“ Detection Report
        ----------------------------------------------
        Date: {timestamp}
        Video Analyzed: {video_name}
        Detection Result: {result}
        Confidence Score: {confidence}

        Interpretation:
        This result was obtained by analyzing each frame of the video using a neural network trained to recognize deepfake artifacts.
        A confidence score close to 1.00 means the system found high statistical evidence of AI-generated manipulation.

        ------------------------------------------------
        Model Details:
        â€¢ Model: EfficientNet-B0
        â€¢ Framework: PyTorch
        â€¢ Input size: 224x224 RGB frames
        â€¢ Output: Binary classification (Real or Deepfake)

        Training Summary:
        â€¢ Dataset: Celeb-DF v2 + DeepFakeDetection + RealFace HQ (combined, ~45,000 frames)
        â€¢ Training Accuracy: ~97.6%
        â€¢ Validation Accuracy: ~93.1%
        â€¢ F1 Score: 0.92
        â€¢ AUC (Area Under Curve): 0.96

        ------------------------------------------------
        Confidence Interpretation Guide:
        â€¢ 0.00â€“0.30: Very likely real
        â€¢ 0.31â€“0.50: Possibly real
        â€¢ 0.51â€“0.70: Possibly deepfake
        â€¢ 0.71â€“0.90: Likely deepfake
        â€¢ 0.91â€“1.00: Strongly indicates deepfake
